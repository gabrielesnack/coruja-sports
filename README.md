You need to install backend wich was made by colleague of university
[TCC-Backend](https://github.com/Uchihinha/tcc-backend)

it's important to say that we didn't hosted the backend app and so if you try to use front app that is hosted it will not work as the last version locally. obviously you need to run backend as well. 

## How to install the front APP

If you have already node installed just use the follow command:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Starting

To initialize the serve:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open the link [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
